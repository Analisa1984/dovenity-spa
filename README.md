## Testing and Results from final testing:

4. CSS validation was done using an online CSS validator, The W3C CSS Validation Service:

## Results from Testing:

## Fixed:

1. Accessibility - Due to Web Accessibility Checks initially being low, aria-labels were then added to links, dropdown menu options, buttons and the video. All images has alt attributes.

2. Contrast standards - Also the contrast standards were not met and the background color which was initially an image was changed to a background color. The image could have been used but the brightness and saturation would have been lessened. Also, the background image seemed to be distracting from the information content on the page which would have defeated the purpose of the webpage. A web contrast checker was used to help check for the required contrast standards. This also improved accesibility.
